        <h3>Introducing Digital Mapping at the Museum of the Moving Image</h3><br>
        <img src="imgs/wayfinding.png" class="img-fluid" alt="image of api response">
        <br>

        <p>For my final project for the course Museums and Digital Culture, I wrote both a Grant Proposal and Request for Proposal outlining an initiative to introduce digital mapping of the floorplan in the Museum of the Moving Image. This project required an understanding of the relationship between the physical aspects of the museum with the proposed use of digital tools to enhance the museum’s mission. I considered ways in which digital mapping could benefit visitors of the museum, as well as offer long term benefits and sustainability to the museum.</p>

        <p>This project involved multiple site visits to the Museum of the Moving Image, and an analysis of the existing layout of the museum. I observed how visitors (and myself) moved through the museum and how they engaged with activities and exhibitions. I then developed an organizational profile and narrative for the museum to further identify what the goals of the museum currently are. Using my research, analysis, and case studies, I then made the motivation that a redesigned floorplan and the addition of digital mapping kiosks would benefit both the museum and the visitors  in the short and long term. Mapping, or wayfinding, kiosks are generally the size of a computer or tablet screen, and allow visitors to locate themselves within a floor plan. </p>

        <p>This project allowed me to articulate the opportunity for a relationship between museums and digital technologies. So often, technology is used as an extra feature or as a costly novelty, in an attempt to stay current and ahead of trends. For this project I considered whether a digitally oriented addition (in the form of digital mapping kiosks) to the Museum of the Moving Image would actually benefit their programming and floorplan, or if it would serve as a distraction for visitors engaging with the collection. Through site visits, research, case studies, and analysis, I was able to identify and argue how this particular concept would serve as a benefit to the visitors of the museum, and would also be a positive investment for the museum to make.</p>

        <h3>James Turrell: SNAC Record Reconciliation</h3><br>
        <img src="imgs/snacapi.png" class="img-fluid" alt="image of api response">
        <br><br>
        <p>For my final project in Museum Information Management, I demonstrated how to link entities in SNAC (Social Networks  and Archival Context) records. I chose the artist James Turrell, an artist I have long admired and previously studied. I had included a work by James Turrell in my mid term project for the same course, and chose to enhance his SNAC record because he is a popular contemporary artist with many relationships I am aware of and was interested in documenting. The outcome of this project was to identify potential issues with the existing SNAC record and to enhance it by linking to artworks, related entities, and biographical data sources in order to increase the availability and accessibility of data related to the Light and Space artist James Turrell.</p>

        <p>I began this project by assessing the current records associated with “James Turrell” on SNAC. I found that there were four entities that included “James Turrell” in their name, however two of the four records were referencing other homonymous individuals, while the remaining two records referenced the artist James Turrell and could be merged. I conducted research to identify contemporary artists and institutions relevant to Turrell that could be linked to his record, such as Eric Orr, Robert Irwin, and MASS MoCA (all of which had existing SNAC records.) Finally, I used the DP.LA API to identify and extract archival works of art that could be added to his SNAC record. </p>

        <p>This project required the application of API best practices, named entity reconciliation, and an understanding of controlled vocabularies for name resolution. By enhancing James Turrell’s SNAC record, I attempted to strengthen the accessibility of archival material not only for this particular artist, but for his contemporaries, relevant institutions, and the artistic movement he is associated with. For this project I used a combination of my background in Art History and an external data repository (in this case DP.LA) to enrich Turrell’s record, which can be extended to include new developments in the future. This project showcases my ability to problem solve and apply best practices when it comes to information management processes.</p>

        <h3>“Surreal Art Bot”: Using GPT2 to create titles of Surrealist works of art</h3><br>

        <img src="imgs/surrealartbot.png" class="img-fluid" alt="image of twitter account">
        <br>
        <p>The deliverable for this project is a Twitter Bot that posts a title of a work of art as a Tweet every day. I wrote a Python script that automatically posts content to a Twitter account via the Twitter API. The titles that this bot posts are a compilation of real, existing titles from the Metropolitan Museum of Art dataset, as well as titles that were generated using GPT 2 (an AI text generator). This bot posts one title every day, and the account itself has some regular engagement from other Twitter users.</p>

        <p>For this project, I downloaded the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s object dataset CSV, and wrote a Python script to isolate and extract the titles of works of art from artists in the Surrealist movement. For this step, I drew from my Art History background to create a list of artists who are associated with the Surrealist movement, and artists who explicitly considered their work as within the Surrealism movement. I then trained the GPT-simple model on this extracted list of titles (see the Github repository for technical workflow). I then combined these two lists of titles, and wrote a Python script using the Twitter API to automatically post one line from this list to a Twitter account.</p>

        <p>I approached this project by considering ways that emerging technologies can be used to serve, amuse, and engage museum audiences. I wanted to connect my interest in AI applications in cultural heritage settings to the various uses of Twitter bots, and as a result I combined both processes to create the Surreal Art Bot. This project speaks to my ability to utilize and combine a wide range of digital tools for the purpose of engaging digital audiences using museum-related data. In this case, by using GPT2, a contemporary and exciting text generating AI model, and Twitter’s API, I was able to create a playful project that encourages imagination and thoughtfulness using museum data.</p>

        <h3>Digital Analytics Report for the Chinati Foundation</h3><br>
        <img src="imgs/chinati.png" class="img-fluid" alt="image of cover of chinati report">
        <br>
        <p>The deliverable for this project was an in depth analysis of the Chinati Foundation’s digital engagement, as observed through their Google Analytics and Vimeo data. It included recommendations for improving the Chinati website, and insights into how users navigate the website. The outcome of this analysis offered the Chinati Foundation the ability to make data driven decisions regarding potential changes to their website.</p>

        <p>We began this project by meeting with the Chinati Foundation archivist, who discussed with us the goals, history, and general mission of the organization. After being granted access to their Google Analytics data, we explored and analyzed the available data, and identified relevant metrics based on the Chinati Foundation’s key concerns. We then moved to Google Data Studio to build an interactive dashboard which served to illustrate and filter trends across their site based on particular controls (user type, age, city, time period, etc). Additionally, I wrote a case study [link] detailing the process of creating this report.</p>

        <p>This project relied on investigating the needs of the Chinati Foundation through researching their mission and history, and interviews with their staff. Our team developed relevant and informed research questions that demonstrated our understanding of the needs of the Chinati Foundation. These research questions guided our process and analysis, and allowed us to focus our data analysis on addressing the specific goals and concerns of the Chinati Foundation. As a result, we created a detailed and robust document that the Chinati Foundation will be able to use for years to come. </p>

        <h3>Art Classification using Neural Networks</h3><br>
        <img src="imgs/artclassifier.png" class="img-fluid" alt="image of art classification result">
        <br>
        <p>For this project I built a neural network to classify works of art in the Museum of Modern Art’s object dataset by medium. In this case, the project classifies whether a work of art in the object dataset is a lithograph. My hope with this project was that it could eventually be extended to any kind of medium.</p>

        <p>For this project I learned how neural networks work in theory and in practice. The main work of this project was cleaning, organizing, and standardizing the images to be ready to feed into the neural network. I downloaded thousands of images from the dataset that were already labeled in the dataset as lithographs, organized them into training and testing folders, then developed the neural net itself by experimenting with various parameters, optimization, and metrics. I then tested the model for accuracy and made adjustments as necessary.</p>

        <p>This project speaks to my ability to learn challenging tools within the context of cultural heritage data. As museums grapple with incorporating technologies that have complicated histories and questionable applications, my interest in understanding the technical aspects of these digital tools speaks to my seriousness about the field and my professional ethics. Throughout the class and final project I analyzed the ethical implications of machine learning projects and systems, such as image classifiers. For museums and cultural heritage institutions to implement digital tools, a sensitivity to the needs of their audience and community is required. As machine learning and computer vision become increasingly relevant to research, accessibility, and engagement methods in museums, it is important for museum information professionals to grapple with the potential uses and misuses of these technologies in a larger social context. Ultimately the work I did on my final project and throughout this course equipped me with the ability to analyze the ethical implications and technical challenges of a wider range of technologies going forward. </p>
